    "            select_list\n",

    "* The search_condition is a combination of one or more predicates using the logical operator AND, OR and NOT.\n",
    "* In MySQL, a predicate is a boolean expression that evaluates to TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWN.\n",
    "* Any row from the table_name that causes the search_condition to evaluate to TRUE will be included in the final result set.\n",
    "* Besides the SELECT statement, you can use the WHERE clause in UPDATE or DELETE statement to specify which rows to update or delete.\n",

    "    FROM --> WHERE --> SELECT --> ORDER BY\n",

    "\n",
    "<code>SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rankscore > 7 ORDER BY rankscore DESC LIMIT 20;</code>\n",

    "<code>SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rankscore=NULL; (**DOES NOT WORK**)</code>\n",
